                    Q: What are the primary symptoms of COVID-19?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ans: Some of the primary symptoms to look for in a Covid 19 infected person are fever, dizziness, breathlessness, headache, dry cough ( eventually result in phlegm) and in a few cases loss in smell and taste. A few cases have also reported diarrhoea and fatigue.

                    Q: Can the coronavirus survive on surfaces?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ans: It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems likely to behave like other coronaviruses. A recent review of the survival of human coronaviruses on surfaces found large variability, ranging from 2 hours to 9 days (11).
                <br>
                The survival time depends on a number of factors, including the type of surface, temperature, relative humidity and specific strain of the virus.

                    Q: What is one of the most effective precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ans: One of the most effective preventive coronavirus tips can be practicing social distancing. You must maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who have issues of cough or are sneezing. Because of the cough, or sneezing, the virus may get transmitted through droplets via mouth or nose.

                    Q:What is the origin of COVID-19?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature.

                <p>
                    Q: Is COVID-19 caused by a virus or a bacteria?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ans: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, NOT by bacteria.

                    Q: What are the known coronaviruses that can infect people?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ans: Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ~34%). SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV.

                    Q: How long have coronaviruses existed?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ans: The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 BCE, although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species.

                    Q: How is the COVID-19 disease transmitted?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ans: COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Ans: Drinking water is not transmitting COVID-19. And, if you swim in a swimming pool or in a pond, you cannot get COVID-19 through water. But what can happen, if you go to a swimming pool, which is crowded and if you are close to other the people and if someone is infected, then you can be of course affected.
